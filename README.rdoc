= Blocca.do 
An API for a to-do list application, so that users can authenticate and manage their information externally. Built during mentorship with Bloc.io. 

== Key features and notes:

- Incorporated user authentication using the devise gem. Implemented token based authentication for API routes. Users can create an account then receive a token to utilize in the request AUTHORIZATION header to authenticate each request thus maintain statelessness. 

- Design the demo site interface and design elements Sketch 3.
